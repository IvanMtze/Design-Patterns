# Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that is instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

Creational patterns become important as systems evolve to depend more on object composition than class inheritance.

In fact, there are two recurring themes in these patterns. First, they all encapsulate knowledge about which concrate classes the system uses. Second, they hide how instances of these classes are created and put together.
Consequently, the creational patterns give you a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created and when.
